This was a fun project to see if I could recreate the striking UI of Mass State
Keno and as an exercise with [Argo] and [Alamofire]. Additionally, I also tried
my hand at [coordinators][coord]. It's a bastardized version of coordinators, so
much so that I'm not sure if it offers any benefit. This is a direct symptom of
relying on InterfaceBuilder.
